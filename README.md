# hugo-lambda-python
Inspired from ryan's project https://github.com/ryansb/hugo-lambda.git (which I could never get to work properly because docs where missing info) and simplified to only include the python lambda function and removed alll the special static file process, therefore this will regenerate the hugo site on every change to site.
# TO-DO
Add more documentation on the whole process and automate setup with terraform or cloudformation and write about my cost of operation now moving from godaddy to aws lambda for my hugo static website.
